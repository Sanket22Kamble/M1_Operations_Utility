## SWOT
* STRENGTHS

  The ultimate strength Calculators is its innovative, user-friendly and long lasting etc..

* WEAKNESSES

  Do not inlude all the operations rather have onlty addition,subtraction multiplication, division ,modulas ,power and factorial.

* OPPORTUNITIES

  The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And this calculator comparatively already one step ahead than other

* THREATS

  The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
