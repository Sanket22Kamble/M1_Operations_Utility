## Description
 # Simple Basic Calculator
 ##  *Introduction:-
 * Simple Calculator helps users to calculate simple calculations with great speed and accessibility. 
    Simple calculator is a project to allow users to calculate basic four operations in mathematics ,they are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division but in this Project which I'm Implementing ,also included three additional operations such as Factorial, Power ,modulas .However, the input has to be in the form "number1 operator1 number2 "(i.e 2+4).
    
    * The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works.Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction/factorial/power/modulas, in another word it is implemented with the order of precedence logic.



## Requirements

## High Level Requirements:
* User should able to viewe operation list.
* User should able to select the operation.
* The system sould able perform the given operation	 
* The system should provide correct result

 

## Low Level Requirements
* If the calculations is impossible the calculator has to display information helping
  the user to resolve the erroneous situation.
* On encountering a division by 0 the display should read "Cannot divide by 0" and typing the
  key “C” should reset the calculator.
* On calculating the square root value of a negative operand the display should read "Wrong
  operand".



## SWOT
* STRENGTHS

  The ultimate strength Calculators is its innovative, user-friendly and long lasting etc..

* WEAKNESSES

  Do not inlude all the operations rather have onlty addition,subtraction multiplication, division ,modulas ,power and factorial.

* OPPORTUNITIES

  The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And this calculator comparatively already one step ahead than other

* THREATS

  The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
