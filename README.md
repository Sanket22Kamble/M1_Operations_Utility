## Description
 # Simple Calculator
 ##  Introduction:-
 * Simple Calculator helps users to calculate simple calculations with great speed and accessibility. 
    Simple calculator is a project to allow users to calculate basic four operations in mathematics ,they are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division but in this Project which I'm Implementing ,also included three additional operations such as Factorial, Power ,modulas .
 * The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and  that particular operation works.Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction/factorial/power/modulas, in another word it is implemented with the order of precedence logic.
